Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. They are naturally replenished.
Solar power is generated by converting sunlight into electricity, typically using photovoltaic (PV) panels. Significant advancements have been made in PV efficiency.
Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of wind using large turbines. Offshore wind farms are a growing trend due to stronger, more consistent winds.
Geothermal energy utilizes heat from the Earth's interior. It's a reliable source but geographically limited.
Hydropower generates electricity from the movement of water, often through dams. It's a mature technology but can have environmental impacts.
Recent breakthroughs in battery technology, particularly lithium-ion, are crucial for storing intermittent renewable energy.
Nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source that does not produce greenhouse gases during operation, but it generates radioactive waste.
Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are non-renewable and contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions when burned.
